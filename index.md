# Teaching

I teach foundational courses in computer science, such as programming, as well as advanced courses in data science, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, social media analysis, and natural language processing. All of my lectures are supplemented by practical projects that use various programming languages (eg., Python, R, C++). My primary audience consists of computer science students (BSc in Computer Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence), but I also engage with interdisciplinary programs, such as the MSc in Digital Humanities and MSc related to computational social sciences.
