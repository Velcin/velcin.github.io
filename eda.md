# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

## Teacher

Pr Julien Velcin, Ecole Centrale de Lyon

## Material

- Lecture: [slides](https://velcin.github.io/files/BSC/eda_slides.pdf)

## Lab sessions

**Lab Session 1:** Intro to pandas and basic EDA

- Objective: Get comfortable with the core toolkit and perform basic operations on a single dataset
- Format: Highly guided Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions
- Tasks: Loading a CSV file, filtering rows, preprocessing (eg., missing values), basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, count), and creating the first simple visualizations (bar charts, histograms) to find initial clues

Exercices: [gitlab](https://gitlab.ec-lyon.fr/jvelcin/bsc-eda.git)

**Lab Session 2:** Advanced Pandas and relational data

- Objective: Move from highly guided instructions to more autonomy, perform more advanced operations
- Format: Semi-guided problem-solving with instructions given in a separate document
- Tasks: Data cleaning (dealing with data types, missing values, outliers), using multiple source tables

- Exercices: [instructions](https://velcin.github.io/files/BSC/lab2.pdf) - [data](https://velcin.github.io/files/BSC/acc-data.zip)

**Lab Session 3:** Numpy and matrix operations

- Objective: Look under the hood of data structures and apply Linear Algebra concepts to numerical data
- Format: Mathematical programming exercises
- Tasks: Introduction to Numpy arrays, broadcasting, and matrix manipulation

**Lab Session 4:** Using APIs and dealing with textual data

- Objective: Learn to handle unstructured data (text) and fetch real-time information from the web
- Format: Exploratory notebook with a provided API wrapper
- Tasks: basic text processing (tokenization, stop-words removal), calculate word frequencies, generate word clouds, querying a simple Web API, basics of topic modeling

**Lab Session 5:** End-to-End project and storytelling

- Objective: Act as a lead data analyst by running a full pipeline and presenting actionable insights
- Format: Autonomous project based on a short problem statement
- Tasks: Fetch data via an API, clean it, explore it, and select the most impactful visualizations. The final deliverable requires applying data storytelling principles: a clean, commented notebook and a few slides where visual cues are used sparingly to highlight the key findings
